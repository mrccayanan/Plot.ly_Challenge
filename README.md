# Plot.ly_Challenge
 Belly Button Biodiversity

In this challenge, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet.

- Used Plotly.js to build interactive charts for your dashboard.


1. - Created a PIE chart that uses data from your samples route (/samples/<sample>) to display the top 10 samples.


- Used sample_values as the values for the PIE chart.


- Used otu_ids as the labels for the pie chart.


- Used otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.


2. - Created a Bubble Chart that uses data from your samples route (/samples/<sample>) to display each sample.


Used otu_ids for the x values.


Used sample_values for the y values.


Used sample_values for the marker size.


Used otu_ids for the marker colors.


Used otu_labels for the text values.
