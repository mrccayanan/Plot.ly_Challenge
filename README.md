# Plot.ly_Challenge
 Belly Button Biodiversity

In this challenge, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet.

- Used Plotly.js to build interactive charts for your dashboard.


- Created a PIE chart that uses data from your samples route (/samples/<sample>) to display the top 10 samples.


- Used sample_values as the values for the PIE chart.


- Used otu_ids as the labels for the pie chart.


- Used otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.
